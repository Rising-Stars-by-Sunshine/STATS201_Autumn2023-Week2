## CHILDES (Data's Origin)

Utilizing Natural Language Processing was crucial for accessing open text data. Following Lee's research approach, the CHILDES database (http://childes.talkbank.org/) was identified as a valuable resource. CHILDES offers labeled text transcripts for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Specific Language Impairment, or Typical Development. This data is instrumental in classifying children according to these categories.
