Random Forest could enhance rabies research by analyzing relationships between trash management practices and rabies spread. 
Incorporating waste management data into the machine learning model can provide deeper insights, 
potentially improving rabies control strategies through predictive analysis.

A Naive Bayes classifier, applied to rabies data, could efficiently predict outbreaks by evaluating the 
correlation between trash management and rabies transmission, given its proficiency of handling classification
problems based on conditional probabilities and 
feature independence assumptions. Integrating waste management data would further refine the model's accuracy.
