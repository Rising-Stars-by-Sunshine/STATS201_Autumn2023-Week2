# Welcome to Yuri Park's Page
## Introduction
I am an undergraduate student from Duke Kunshan University.
With my special interest in education and passion in communication,
many of may projects involve communicating messages that are
educative at the same time, interactive. 
With using P5.Js mainly, most of the projects are done in JavaScript.
