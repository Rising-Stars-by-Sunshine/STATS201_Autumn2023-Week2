# Welcome to Yuri Park's Page
## Introduction
I am an undergraduate student from Duke Kunshan University.
With my special interest in education and passion in communication,
many of may projects involve communicating messages that are
educative at the same time, interactive. 
With using P5.Js mainly, most of the projects are done in JavaScript.

## Current Project's Update
Under the inspiration of Lee's research, my research focuses on the potential of the Random Forest algorithm in addressing the conclusion from Lee's 2016 study, which stated: “Comparing the confusion matrices of all classifiers, it is observed that the ASD class has the lowest precision and F-measure across all classes, even after feature extraction” (Lee, 2016, pg. 33). I would like to know if precision for ASD can be improved as This interest is according to Dewi and Imah's 2020 research, it’s found that 'based on the specificity and sensitivity value, the Random Forest algorithm with full features is the best algorithm compared to others in classifying ASD in children and adolescents' (Dewi & Imah, 2020, pg. 152). Therefore, I am eager to explore whether Random Forest can not only solve the issues identified in Lee's study but also outperform the SVM, which was the most consistent and best-performing machine learning algorithm in Lee's research, with an accuracy score of 87% +/- 3% (Lee, 2016, pg. 32)."

## Todo List
For this project to continue, the following needs to be completed in the order of hierarchy
1. Implement the code based on Lee's research
2. Study the Random Forest ML equation and consider what is the parameter setting for Random Forest
