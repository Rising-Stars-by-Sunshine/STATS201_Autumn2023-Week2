The research summary underscores the challenges highlighted by Lee regarding the complexity and specialist dependency of the current diagnostic methods. It further emphasizes the need for careful consideration in feature detection, recognizing the potential for both misdiagnosis and overlapping characteristics. This intricacy not only increases the likelihood of misinterpretation but also adds a layer of difficulty in definitively attributing specific features to a single disability or accurately diagnosing the predominant disability.
