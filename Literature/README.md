# Literature Review's Breakdown
The literature reivew section is broken down into 3 differnet parts to better understnad and preapre the research question that will be answered: Can Random Forest surpass the consistently high-performing SVM, which attained an accuracy score of 87% +/- 3% in Lee's study (Lee, 2016, pg. 32)? Furthermore, how can the addition of Random Forest contribute to a deeper understanding of language impairment, propelling research advancements in this field?

## [What is Lee's Research Project Like](/Literature/Lee_Research)
The literature review of Lee's project provides a summary of the most significant findings and outlines the steps taken in his research, serving as a guide for replication. Therefore, comprehending Lee's research is pivotal for a thorough understanding of the background and context of my own study.

## [Currnet research about Random Forest in this scenario](/Literature/Random_Research)
Examining the recent research on Random Forest in 2023 provides valuable insights into why it gained prominence and what attributes make it the optimal algorithm. This understanding is crucial in determining the ideal parameter settings for Random Forest within the context of this research.

## [What is the research about language impairment like?](/Literature/Language_Research)
Through a comprehensive literature review on language impairment in children, there is an opportunity for a deeper exploration to understand the real-world implications of existing research. This involves recognizing the features that are well-captured or potentially missing in the current research landscape. These insights will serve as a foundation to assess whether the addition of Random Forest enhances the accuracy of feature importance in language impairment for future reseach beyond this.

## Overall
The literature research has provided valuable insights into the conduct of research in this field, elucidating the challenges associated with detecting Specific Language Impairment (SLI) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It has also shed light on the effectiveness of Random Forest in this research domain. The details concerning features, particularly the methodology behind Random Forest, will play a crucial role in implementing aspects of Lee's work into my research. However, there is room for further exploration of findings related to important features, warranting additional research in this area.
