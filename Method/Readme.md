# The Prediction Problem

## Research Question Formulation:
The traditional approach to diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has faced significant challenges, including inconvenience and potential inaccuracy. The traditional method typically required the presence of clinicians and trained linguists. Additionally, diagnoses were often based on comparisons with the average scores of a reference population. Children scoring at least 1.25 times below the standard deviation (SD) in two or more measures were considered to have Language Impairment (LI). However, Campbell et al. (1997) noted that such norm-referenced tests could be biased, leading to inaccuracies (Lee, 2016, pg. 4).

To address these issues of inaccessibility and inaccuracy, the research from Lee has proposed the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). This approach involves using NLP to extract linguistic features indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Machine Learning algorithms would then be employed to predict the likelihood of a child having LI (ASD or SLI) based solely on text analysis (Lee, 2016, pg. 1). Specifically, using classification, the expected result after the ML prediction will be “predicting a label for the data set with an acceptable accuracy rating” (Lee, 2016, pg. 8). This technological advancement aims to improve the diagnostic process for ASD, making it more accessible and accurate (Lee, 2016, pg. 4). However, indeed being a good approach, having this research being conducted in 2016, as now is 2023, more research has been conducting regarding this field of interest. Thus, based on the recent research, I concluded there are two potential things I can add to this research:

Adding a feature that makes the prediction more tailored towards differentiating SLI, ASD, and TD.

Adding an ML algorithm, specifically Random Forrest, as according to recent research, Random Forrest was proven to be the most accurate (Dewi & Imah, 2020; Qureshi et al., 2023) and Lee did not include Random Forrest but just a decision tree classifier.

## Operational Measures:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) now aids in identifying key factors indicative of ASD and SLI without the need for manual classification. However, differentiating between ASD and SLI remains challenging due to overlapping and distinct features influencing how a child is categorized. To clarify, SLI is defined as a 'delayed or disordered language pattern in the absence of other sensory, neurological, or intellectual abnormalities,' which can also adversely impact a child's social development and academic achievement. Certain indicative factors like unique characteristics of morphology, syntax, and phonology are similar in both conditions. Yet, ASD typically includes pragmatic impairments and broader developmental difficulties beyond language issues. Differences are also shown here in the research conducted by Schaeffer:
