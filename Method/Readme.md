# The Prediction Problem

## Research Question Formulation:
* **Objective**: The traditional approach to diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has encountered significant challenges, including inconvenience and potential inaccuracy. Typically, this method necessitated the presence of clinicians and trained linguists. Diagnoses were often established by comparing scores to the averages of a reference population. Children scoring at least 1.25 times below the standard deviation (SD) in two or more measures were considered to have Language Impairment (LI). However, Campbell et al. (1997) noted that such norm-referenced tests could be biased, leading to inaccuracies (Lee, 2016, pg. 4). Furthermore, with overlapping features, the difficulty of correctly identifying differences between Specific Language Impairment (SLI) and ASD, and even other disabilities, was found to be challenging through the specialist's record alone. Thus, the objective measurements provided by machine learning serve to potentially address the initial problem of misdiagnosis from a human standpoint.

* **Significance**: To address the challenges of inaccessibility and inaccuracy, Lee's research proposes leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). This approach involves employing NLP to extract linguistic features indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Subsequently, Machine Learning algorithms are utilized to predict the likelihood of a child having Language Impairment (LI), encompassing ASD or SLI, based solely on text analysis (Lee, 2016, pg. 1). Specifically, the classification process aims to achieve an acceptable accuracy rating for predicting labels in the dataset (Lee, 2016, pg. 8). This technological advancement seeks to enhance the accessibility and accuracy of the ASD diagnostic process (Lee, 2016, pg. 4). However, given that Lee's research was conducted in 2016, recent advancements in the field have led to further investigations. To ensure the continued relevance and potential impact of Lee's work, I have introduced the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Recent studies (Dewi & Imah, 2020; Qureshi et al., 2023) have demonstrated that Random Forest is more accurate than the decision tree classifier used by Lee. This addition aims to contribute to the ongoing progress in this research field.

## Operational Measures:
* **Variable**: In the overall research framework, the X variable represents the data sourced from CHILDES, comprising distinct text-based inputs from children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), or Typical Development (TD). The Y variable corresponds to the accuracy results generated by the algorithms selected by Lee. Now, in my research, as I introduce the evaluation of the entire research output by incorporating the Random Forest Algorithm into Lee's study, the X variable becomes the Random Forest Algorithm itself. The Y variable remains as the accuracy results yielded by the algorithms, facilitating a comparison of the changes in prediction accuracies with and without the inclusion of the Random Forest Algorithm.
* **Data Type**: The research utilizes cross-sectional data sourced from text-based transcripts within the CHILDES database. This data is specifically recorded in the context of children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), or Typical Development (TD) being prompted to retell a story to an adult.

## Hypothesis Development:
* **Prediction Hypothesis**: The integration of the Random Forest algorithm would alter the original ranking, resulting in it being the most superior among all.
* **Justification**:As discussed in the literature review, the efficacy of the Random Forest algorithm in classifying Specific Language Impairment (SLI) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) stands out, demonstrating superior efficiency in the language impairment classification process. Additionally, Dewi and Imah's 2020 research emphasizes the Random Forest algorithm's superiority, stating that, 'based on specificity and sensitivity values, the Random Forest algorithm with full features is the optimal choice for classifying ASD in children and adolescents' (Dewi & Imah, 2020, pg. 152). This prompts my curiosity to explore whether Random Forest can not only address the challenges identified in Lee's study but also surpass the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM), which was the most consistent and highest-performing machine learning algorithm in Lee's research, boasting an accuracy score of 87% +/- 3% (Lee, 2016, pg. 32).
* **Machine Learning Algorithm Selection**: As stated above with the reasonings, Random Forest is the chosen algorithm.

# The Machine Learning Workflow

## Model Development:
The idea of NLP is that we are allowing the computer to break down the sentence by tokenization – the process of converting a sequence of text into smaller parts, known as tokens – and part-of-speech tagging (POS) to analyze the semantics and associate with a feature to distinguish between TD, ASD, or SLI children. Such a method would allow NLP to be executed to measure such as the mean length of utterance, total number of words, and even sentence complexity for intelligence and more. *As a common trait, many features are usually employed to detect LI in children, and feature with algorithm enhances the precision (Lee, 2016, pg. 6).

With supervised classification, “detecting patterns is central to NLP as these patterns usually hold new meaning that can be derived from a sentence” (Lee, 2016, pg. 6). As for this research, Lee was using supervised classification, which means after NLP finds the features, the training was done under supervision to teach what is true to generate models and the corresponding feature sets to complete the prediction phase using the MLs.

## Result Presentation & Model Evaluation
With ML, ML algorithm is employed to predict classification labels like TD (Typically Developing), ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), or SLI (Specific Language Impairment) based on the input data. Each algorithm employs a distinct method to reach its conclusions, which allows for observation and analysis of how features are classified and detected. Consequently, different ML algorithms yield varying results. This variation implies that each algorithm has its unique strengths. Poliker's strategy capitalizes on this by using multiple learning algorithms simultaneously, aiming to achieve higher predictive capability than what would be possible with each algorithm individually (Lee, 2016, pg. 7). Thus, as my research is based on Lee’s research, I would do the similar. Thus, even for the data visualization, using a confusion matrix, I will compare the results of each ML algorithm before and after the feature extraction to each other as well as to the baseline performance as the evaluation(Lee, 2016, pg. 20).

Specifically, for evaluation purposes, metrics such as precision, recall, and F-measure will be calculated using the following formula.

Additionally, by introducing the Random Forest algorithm as an additional machine learning model, we will assess its performance based on parameters provided by Random Forest, such as max depth.
