# Impact of Adding Random Forrest


Incorporating a Random Forest classifier into this research adds a robust and versatile model known for its high accuracy and ability to handle large datasets with multiple features. Random Forest, an ensemble method comprising numerous decision trees, excels in reducing overfitting and increasing predictive accuracy. It achieves this by averaging the results of individual trees, which individually may be prone to overfitting. Its inclusion would enhance the research by providing a more comprehensive analysis, especially in complex classification tasks like distinguishing between SLI, ASD, and TD speech patterns.
